      Mobile Application depends on the content and materials you use, and
      includes:<br />

      <u>Personal Information</u><br />
      <br />
      Demographic and other personally identifiable information (such as your
      name, mobile number and email address) that you voluntarily give us when
      you register with the Website/Mobile Application or when choosing to
      participate in various activities related to the Website/Mobile
      Application, such as your age, gender, address, interests, writing
      reviews, chat, posting messages in comment sections or in our forums,
      rating Experts, sending feedback, and responding to surveys. If you choose
      to share data about yourself via your profile, online chat, or other
      interactive areas of the Website/Mobile Application, please be advised
      that all data you disclose in these areas is public and your data will be
      accessible to anyone who accesses the Website/Mobile Application. You are
      under no obligation to provide us with personal information of any kind,
      however your refusal to do so may prevent you from using certain features

      to the Website/Mobile Application, including your IP address, your browser
      type, your operating system, your access times, the pages you have viewed
      directly before and after accessing the Website/Mobile Application your
      liking, rating, re-blogging, or replying to a post, as well as other
      interactions with the Website/Mobile Application and other users via
      server log files.<br />
      <br />
      <u>Financial Information</u><br />
      <br />
      Financial information, such as data related to your payment method (e.g.,
      valid credit card/debit card number, card brand, expiration date), that we
      may collect when you purchase, order, exchange, or request information
      about our services from the Website/Mobile Application. We store only very
      limited, if any, financial information that we collect. Otherwise, all
      financial information is stored by our payment processors (RazorPay) and
      you are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them
      directly for responses to your questions.<br />
      <br />
      If the data subject resides outside India then the payment has to be made
      through &quot;PayPal&quot; during the ordering process, we automatically
      transmit the data of the data subject to PayPal. By selecting this payment
      option, the data subject agrees to the transfer of personal data required
      for payment processing.<br />
      <br />
      The personal data transmitted to PayPal is usually first name, last name,
      address, email address, IP address, telephone number, mobile phone number,
      or other data necessary for payment processing. The processing of the
      purchase contract also requires such personal data, which are in
      connection with the respective order.<br />
      <br />
      The transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing and fraud
      prevention. The controller will transfer personal data to PayPal, in
      particular, if a legitimate interest in the transmission is given. The
      personal data exchanged between PayPal and the controller for the
      processing of the data will be transmitted by PayPal to economic credit
      agencies. This transmission is intended for identity and creditworthiness
      checks.<br />
      <br />
      PayPal will, if necessary, pass on personal data to affiliates and service
      providers or subcontractors to the extent that this is necessary to
      fulfill contractual obligations or for data to be processed in the order.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the handling of
      personal data at any time from PayPal. A revocation shall not have any
      effect on personal data, which must be processed, used or transmitted in
      accordance with (contractual) payment processing. The applicable data
      protection provisions of PayPal may be retrieved under the policy provided
      by PayPal.<br />
